                <p>I am a mother of 4 beautiful children ranging in age from 3 to 22. I have been married to my extremely supportive husband for 13 wonderful years. While I am currently a nurse at a long-term care facility (and love what I do), I long to find a job that appeals to my creative side. In order to fulfill this longing, I have added “student” to the many hats I already wear. </p>
<p>While trying to find a new career that includes helping others, being creative, challenging and rewarding I managed to find Web Developing. Learning has always been a passion of mine and Web Developing is an ever changing, ever growing area to which there is always something new to learn. There is a sense of accomplishment in helping others achieve their dreams while achieving your own. </p>
<p>I am currently enrolled in my third semester of an Information Technology: Web Developer – Associates Degree program. I am also working towards a Web Developer Certificate and Advanced Web Developer Certificate. My degree is projected to be completed Spring 2021.</p>
<p>I enjoy DIY projects and trying to figure out how things are made. Crafting makes me smile and I have taught myself how to sew and crochet among many other things. In my free time I find myself looking for new information on the skills I have learned so far. As a mother, a wife, a nurse, a student and a caretaker I am very skilled at the art of multitasking.</p>
